# Application Specification
The application is a sports management platform providing users with tools to track player performance, stream live matches, view sports news, interact socially with other fans, purchase tickets for events, and access these features securely through a user authentication system.
The system is designed to cater to a wide variety of users, including sports fans, team managers, event organizers, and content providers.
## Problem Statement
Sports fans, managers, and organizers struggle with using multiple platforms to track player stats, watch live games, buy tickets, and stay updated on news.
This creates a messy, disconnected experience. There's also a need for secure user authentication and a better way for fans to connect with each other.
We need a single platform that brings all these features together in one place, making it easy, secure, and fun to use.
